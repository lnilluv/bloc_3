#  🗂️ Projects
- 🏪 **Walmart Sales**

> Walmart's marketing service has asked you to build a machine learning model able to estimate the weekly sales in their stores, with the best precision possible on the predictions made. Such a model would help them understand better how the sales are influenced by economic indicators, and might be used to plan future marketing campaigns.

- 📧 **Conversion Rate Challenge**
> The data scientists who created the newsletter would like to understand better the behaviour of the users visiting their website. They would like to know if it's possible to build a model that predicts if a given user will subscribe to the newsletter, by using just a few information about the user. They would like to analyze the parameters of the model to highlight features that are important to explain the behaviour of the users, and maybe discover a new lever for action to improve the newsletter's conversion rate.

> They designed a competition aiming at building a model that allows to predict the conversions (i.e. when a user will subscribe to the newsletter). To do so, they open-sourced a dataset containing some data about the traffic on their website. To assess the rankings of the different competing teams, they decided to use the f1-score.

----------
- 🚖 **Uber Pickups**
> One of the main pain point that Uber's team found is that sometimes drivers are not around when users need them. For example, a user might be in San Francisco's Financial District whereas Uber drivers are looking for customers in Castro.

> Eventhough both neighborhood are not that far away, users would still have to wait 10 to 15 minutes before being picked-up, which is too long. Uber's research shows that users accept to wait 5-7 minutes, otherwise they would cancel their ride.

> Therefore, Uber's data team would like to work on a project where their app would recommend hot-zones in major cities to be in at any given time of day.
